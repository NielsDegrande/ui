# General

## Comments

When writing comments:

- Punctuate all sentences.
- Do not contract words.
- Avoid trivial comments that do not add value.
- Prefix TODOs with `TODO: `.
- When changing the internals of a class, method or function, update the docstring to reflect the change. Do not add new information, rather correct outdated information.
