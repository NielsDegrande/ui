# TypeScript

## Structure

- Avoid putting all in one index.ts file. Use multiple files to improve readability and maintainability.

## Commenting and Documentation

- Write TSDoc comments for all public classes, methods, and functions. At least use the `@param` tag for parameters and `@returns` for return values.
- End all inline comments with a period.
- Use a space after the comment marker.
